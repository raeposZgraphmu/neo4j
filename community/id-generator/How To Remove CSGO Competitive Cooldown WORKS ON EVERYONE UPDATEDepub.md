## What causes competitive cooldowns?
 
Competitive cooldowns are issued by Steam Support to ensure that CS:GO matches are enjoyable for all players on the server. When a player commits actions that negatively impact the match and other players in the match, they may receive a competitive cooldown that keeps them from playing matchmaking for a set period of time. Competitive cooldowns are issued regardless of whether or not the infraction was intentional and explicit warnings are given to players before committing an action that will result in a cooldown[^1^].
 
Competitive cooldowns are issued for the following reasons[^1^]:
 
- Failing to stay connected to the server: Any player who cannot remain connected or reconnect to the server in time will receive a competitive cooldown. This may be caused by network, technical, or local issues with your machine, but any time a player leaves a competitive server and does not reconnect in time a competitive cooldown will be issued.
- New players may win two competitive matches in 24 hours: New players may win 2 competitive matches in 24 hours before receiving an intentional competitive cooldown. This cooldown exists to limit the impact new accounts can have on matchmaking. After 10 competitive wins the new player cooldown is removed and there is no limit to the number of competitive wins you may earn in 24 hours.
- Kicking too many teammates: Competitive cooldowns are issued to players who kick too many teammates in competitive matches. Regardless of if you called the vote or only pressed 'F1' to kick the player, doing this too often will result in a competitive cooldown for your account.
- Being kicked from too many matches: Competitive cooldowns are issued to players who are kicked from too many matches by their teammates. This is to prevent players from ruining matches for others by being abusive, trolling, or griefing.
- Abandoning matches: Competitive cooldowns are issued to players who abandon matches by leaving before the match is over. This is to discourage players from quitting matches when they are losing or when they don't like their teammates.
- Being AFK or not participating in matches: Competitive cooldowns are issued to players who are AFK (away from keyboard) or not participating in matches by being idle, spinning, or shooting at walls. This is to prevent players from wasting time and resources for others by not contributing to the match.
- Receiving too many in-game reports for griefing: Competitive cooldowns are issued to players who receive too many in-game reports for griefing from other players. Griefing is defined as any action that intentionally harms your own team or disrupts the game for others. Examples of griefing include team killing, team damaging, team flashing, blocking, throwing, or sabotaging.

## How long do competitive cooldowns last?
 
Competitive cooldowns in CS:GO have four levels[^2^]. When an account receives a competitive cooldown, the cooldown level remains on the account for a one-week probationary period. Any additional cooldowns received during the one-week probationary period increases the amount of time players are restricted from matchmaking:

- Level 0 - No Cooldown, next Cooldown is always level 1.
- Level 1 - 30 Minute Cooldown, Resets to level 0 if no cooldown in 7 days.
- Level 2 - 2 Hour Cooldown, Resets to level 1 if no cooldown in 7 days.
- Level 3 - 24 Hour Cooldown, Resets to level 2 if no cooldown in 7 days.
- Level 4 and above - 7 day Cooldown, resets to level 3 depending on the level.

You can determine your current cooldown level by looking at the yellow bar on your profile screen[^2^]. The higher
